Description: Functions to calculate several ecological indices of individual 
    and population niche width (Araujo's E, clustering and pairwise similarity 
    among individuals, IS, Petraitis' W, and Roughgarden's WIC/TNW) to assess 
    individual specialization based on data of resource use. Resource use can 
    be quantified by counts of categories, measures of mass or length, or 
    proportions. Monte Carlo resampling procedures are available for hypothesis 
    testing against multinomial null models.
